# Project-Life-Expectancy-and-GDP

Findings
I find the most countries Life Expectancy went up and is strongly related to their GDP over the years. 
Countries that had not so good of a linear progression, like Chile, Germany and Zimababe, still have a strong relationship 
between their gdp growth and life expectancy.
